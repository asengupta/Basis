Basis provides a set of classes for easily plotting and transforming arbitrary 2D coordinate systems by specifying their basis vectors in Ruby-Processing.

## Installation

To install the Basis gem, first head to the location where the jruby-complete.jar is located, for Ruby-Processing. There, do this:

    java -jar jruby-complete.jar -S gem install basis-processing --user-install

Alternatively, if you're using a conventional JRuby installation, do this:

    sudo jruby -S gem install basis-processing

To use Basis functionality in your code, it is enough to:

    require 'basis_processing'

## Example Code

Here's some example code, which plots random points.

    require 'rubygems'`
    require 'basis_processing'`

    class Demo < Processing::App
    app = self
    def setup
        smooth
        background(0,0,0)
        color_mode(RGB, 1.0)
 
        points = []
        100.times {points << {:x => random(200), :y => random(300)}}
 
        x_basis_vector = {:x => 1.0, :y => 0.0}
        y_basis_vector = {:x => 0.0, :y => 1.0}
 
        x_range = ContinuousRange.new({:minimum => 0, :maximum => 200})
        y_range = ContinuousRange.new({:minimum => 0, :maximum => 300})
 
        basis = CoordinateSystem.new(Axis.new(x_basis_vector,x_range), Axis.new(y_basis_vector,y_range), [[4,0],[0,2]], self)
        screen_transform = SignedTransform.new({:x => 1, :y => -1}, {:x => 300, :y => 900})
        screen = Screen.new(screen_transform, self)
        screen.draw_axes(basis,10,10)
        stroke(1,1,0,1)
        fill(1,1,0)
        rect_mode(CENTER)
        points.each do |p|
                screen.plot(p, basis, :bar => true) {|p| rect(p[:x], p[:y], 5, 5)}
        end
    end
 
    def draw
    end
    end
 
    w = 1200
    h = 1000
 
    Demo.new(:title => "My Sketch", :width => w, :height => h)

You have a few options when plotting a point. Consider the line:

	screen.plot(p, basis, :bar => true) {|p| rect(p[:x], p[:y], 5, 5)}

If you omit `:bar => true` or don't specify any options, Basis will plot the points without connecting them to the X-axis.
If you omit the block at the end of the call, Basis will plot the point using a circle. Use the block to customise how you wish to represent the point graphically.
